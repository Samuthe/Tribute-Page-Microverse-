        <h3 id="headline">Waldo Waterman's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(June 16, 1894 â€“ December 8, 1976)</strong> -He was an inventor and aviation pioneer from San
                Diego,
                California</li>
            <li><strong>1909</strong> - Waterman built his first aircraft, a biplane hang glider, while still in high
                school.
            </li>
            <li><strong>January 1910</strong> - He then took on a partner to help build a powered aircraft that he
                entered
                in the first Dominguez Air Meet.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1911</strong> - Glenn Curtiss moved his winter headquarters to North Island and Waterman
                attached
                himself to the Curtiss camp
            </li>
            <li><strong>1912</strong> -The US Navy moved its three aircraft to Curtiss' testing station. By this time
                Waterman was a fixture at the station and was a frequent ride-along.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1912</strong> -Waterman entered the University of California as a student of mechanical
                engineering.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1929</strong> -Waterman built his first tailless monoplane, the Whatsit,
                which also used the then unusual tricycle landing gear</li>
            <li><strong>1917</strong> -In 1917 he built a flying car he called the Autoplane.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1930</strong>As well as the Whatsit, in 1930 Waterman produced another innovative design
                with a low-wing monoplane that could change the dihedral of its wings during flight for shorter
                takeoffs,
                increased flight speed, and slower landing speeds according to the designer in its debut at the National
                Air
                races in Chicago</li>
            <li><strong>1960</strong> -Waterman built and flew his last aircraft.</li>
            <li><strong>1970s</strong> -Waterman directed the construction of a replica of his biplane hang glider,
                built in
                his youth</li>
            <li><strong>1968</strong> -Waterman was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame</li>
            <br>
            <p><em>Waterman gave Joe Faust of the Self-Soar Association $100 to support its Low & Slow periodical, in
                    which
                    notes about Waldo Waterman's final aircraft construction project appeared.</em></p>
